## Getting Started 

Install `docker, docker-compose`.

Build the image 
```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run the container
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Get the bash (On each terminal to test)
```bash
docker-compose exec ros2_workspace bash
```

Inside the terminal, build the workplace 
```bash
colcon build
```

# Orchestrator 

Inside the terminal, after the workspace is built, run the orchestrator
```bash 
ros2 run orchestrator orchestrator
```

For testing, mock queues are available
```bash
ros2 run orchestrator mock_image_capture ("on one terminal")
ros2 run orchestrator mock_object_detection ("on another terminal")
```

# Others 
There are sample files called `py_pubsub, cpp_pubsub` which show basics of ROS. They'll be removed but feel free to browse for now.
